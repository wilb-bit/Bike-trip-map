# Bike trip map
My mum completed a 6 month solo bikepacking trip from Guatemala to the bottom of South America. Cycling a total of 12,000km.  
I created a map showing the route of the trip using Rstudio.  
This used images from Stamen Maps (access with its API).  
Details on the book can be found at the following website (map is on the front page).
